# About millis()

millis() and delay()

two advantages of using millis() rather than using delay()
1. accurate timing
we can run the loop as often as we want and it does not affected by execution time(as long as the execution time is less than the desired period).
We can not know when would the loop execute since delay() is not possible.

2. non-blocking
we can run the code while "waiting" For example, we can print "Hello" over serial even when the code is doing other things. However, delay() function pauses its whole code.
