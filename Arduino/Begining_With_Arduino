#Embedded C

C/Basic C and Embedded C mostly the same in syntax and structure of code. Many consider Embedded C an extension of the C language.
However, there are subtle differences:
 C is a general purpose programming language, while Embedded C focuses on microprocessor and embedded systems.
Embedded C often interacts with fixed point numbers, I/O ports, and registers. 

#AVR programming

Arduinos are conventionally programming with the C++ Arduino language library. 
However, it is possible to use C to directly program the microprocessor ATmega328P.
The <avr/io.h> header file will need to be included to define the addresses of the registers and ports on the microprocessor.

#Debugging in Arduino IDE

The Arduino IDE does not support breakpoints, this means that you will need another way to check if the program has gone through certain lines of code.
The serial() Arduino functions will allow you to print checkpoints in your code after certain lines. These can act as checkpoints for you to debug with.
