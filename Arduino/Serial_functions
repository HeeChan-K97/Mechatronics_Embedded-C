#Serial.print()

Description
Prints data to the serial port as human-readable ASCII text. This command can take many forms. Numbers are printed using an ASCII character for each digit.
Floats are similarly printed as ASCII digits, defaulting to two decimal places. Bytes are sent as a single character. Characters and strings are sent as is. For example-

Serial.print(78) gives "78"

Serial.print(1.23456) gives "1.23"

Serial.print('N') gives "N"

Serial.print("Hello world.") gives "Hello world."

An optional second parameter specifies the base (format) to use; permitted values are BIN(binary, or base 2), OCT(octal, or base 8), DEC(decimal, or base 10), HEX(hexadecimal, or base 16). 
For floating point numbers, this parameter specifies the number of decimal places to use. For example-

Serial.print(78, BIN) gives "1001110"

Serial.print(78, OCT) gives "116"

Serial.print(78, DEC) gives "78"

Serial.print(78, HEX) gives "4E"

Serial.print(1.23456, 0) gives "1"

Serial.print(1.23456, 2) gives "1.23"

Serial.print(1.23456, 4) gives "1.2345"

#Serial.write()

Description
Writes binary data to the serial port. This data is sent as a byte or series of bytes; 
to send the characters representing the digits of a number use the print() function instead.
