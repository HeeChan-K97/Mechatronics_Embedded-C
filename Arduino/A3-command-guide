CMD_ACT_LAT_*Direction*_*Distance*
Handles lateral movements of the robot. User must specify the direction (0=backwards, or 1 = forwards) and distance value (in metres)

CMD_ACT_ROT_*Direction*_*Angle*
Rotate the robot by a specific angle. User must specify the direction and the angle. (0 = Counter Clockwise, 1 = Clockwise)

CMD_SEN_ IR
Return the IR sensor measurement from the simulation in String type, when out of range, the return value will be NaN

CMD_SEN_ROT_*Angle*
Adjust the angle of the sensor. 0° is where the robot is heading and increasing to 360 Counter-Clockwise

CMD_SEN_CHECK
Return the current angle of the sensor

CMD_SEN_DIST
Return the distance the robot has travelled (robot odometer)

CMD_SEN_PING
Ping the nearest goal, this function returns the distance to the nearest goal if it stays within 5 metre of the goal, otherwise return 0

CMD_SEN_ID
Identify which goal is nearby, only work if the robot is within 2 metre of the goal, return 1 or 2 depend on which goal is nearby, otherwise return 0

CMD_SEN_GOAL
Check what goal the robot achieved, if the robot has reached goal 1, this will return 1, if reached goal 2 will return 2, if have not achieved any goal, will return 0
