Interrupt is used to set a task that has a higher priority in normal program flow. Once an interrupt occur the whole program ceases and handle the issue that interrupt ask to.
Interrupt is a command for an event to occur immediately as soon as it is issued from the micro-controller

There are two types of intterrupt:
Hardware interrupt and Software interrupt

Hardware interrupt: specific hardware can cause the hardware interrupt, a reserved interrupt signal line is connected directly to the CPU.
Software interrupt: interrupts that occur through a kernel in a computer system with an operating system.

Steps:
1. Interrupt occured
2. Stop an operation that is currently in progress
3. Move into ISP(Interrupt Service Routine)
4. Operate the task issued by the interrupt
5. Get back to the progress and start again from where it stopped

When an interrupt take place corresponding ISP is called. And there are three conditions to met:
1. The global interrupt enable bit shall be set.
2. Individual interrupt active bits for each interrupt shall be set.
3. Conditions for interrupt generation shall be met.

sei() : to allow global interrupt enable 'Set interrupt'
cli() : to block globle intterrupt 'clear interrupt'

There are priorities among interrupts, and low-number interrupts have high priorities.
