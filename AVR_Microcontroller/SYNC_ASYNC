Synchronous

Sender and Receiver are sync to a master clock. Data transfer is based on that clock
Faster data transfer, but requires a clock signal line for both the transmitter and receiver

Asynchronous

Sender provides a start and stop signal during data transfer
Slower data transfer but removes the need for a clock signal
